# Scarf generation

## Notes

- blocks of motifs
- separated by a divider (or colour change)
- can use basically whatever divider is interesting (straight line, slight ridge bounding top/bottom)
- build up series of blocks, maybe respecting some rules about their layout? (e.g. no more than N large medalions every N pixels)
- maybe some threshold on % light/dark?


## blocks

- large medalion (repeat)
	- fill in empty space with small designs? Choose from dots or diamonds or something?
	- need rules for building this.
	- needs border
- small medalion (repeat)
	- choice of shapes, diamonds or stripes or hearts
	- needs border



## rules

- large medalion repeat
	- should have symmetrical border
	- enough whitepsace in between
- small medalion
	- e.g. tree or present or hearts or diamonds
	- on blank field
	- alternating ok
- diamond areas are tough
- fade is ok to swap colours
